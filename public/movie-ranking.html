<h1>Best TV Shows According to Nakul</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 TV Shows of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. The Office(US)</h3>
<p>Fuuny, wholesome and the perfect sitcom to watch when bored.</p>
<h3>2. Modern Family</h3>
<p>Again similiar to The Office, but a bit less chaotic.</p>
<h3>3. Ozark</h3>
<p>This movie is about money laundering, and is a bit of a serious movie.</p>
